# Recommending-Movies-using-Cosine-Similarity
This project builds a simple content-based movie recommendation system using cosine similarity. It uses metadata from a dataset to recommend movies that are similar to the one selected by the user.
pandas :-               For loading and manipulating the movie dataset (CSV files, DataFrames).
scikit-learn (sklearn):-For:
                              CountVectorizer — to convert text to feature vectors.
                              cosine_similarity — to compute similarity scores.

numpy:-                  For numerical operations and working with arrays (optional but often used alongside pandas).

matplotlib:-Used to:
                    Plot bar charts of similarity scores
                    Show distribution of genres or ratings
seaborn:-Used to:
                Create more elegant visualizations like heatmaps or pair plots
